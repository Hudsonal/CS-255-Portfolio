1. The DriverPass project that wanted to help new drivers with the process of learning how to drive and handle the tests the DMV has and this was brought up by the client, Liam, for me to create this system and implement if needed
2. What I did well with would be the the creatiopn of the UML activity diagrams and the sequence diagram
3. If I had to improve on one part of this project, I would choose the class diagram. I would improve it by gathering more information on the requirements and use that to better fufill the diagram's overall design
4. I implented the needs by simply understanding them at a logical basis and decided from there what to do. It's important to know and implement client needs decause it will allow for a better overall design for the client
5. I approach software design by creating pseudocode for the programs while implementing client needs. I wuold use the use case diagram and the activity diagram in the future for designing software.
